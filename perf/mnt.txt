If you have not already done so, make sure the VirtualBox Guest Additions are already installed (top
menu -> Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD, then follow the prompts)

On the host, go to VirtualBox window:

  top menu -> Devices -> Shared Folders -> Shared Folder Settings

  Click "+" icon on right
    - Under "Folder Path" navigate to an absolute pathname like /home/joe/myFolder
    - Under "Folder Name" enter a unique ID like "someName"

On guest vm, open a terminal and type:

  > sudo mkdir -p /mystuff
  > sudo mount -t vboxsf someName /mystuff

The trick is that the ID string "someName" is just a tag to connect the host directory and the VM
directory.  It has not other purpose. The shared folder /home/joe/myFolder is now available as the
dir /mystuff in the VM.

The VirtualBox GUI does not make a clear distinction between the directory name on the host, the directory
name on the VM, and the ID string that connects them.
